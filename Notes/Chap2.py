Chap 2:

Program Development Cycle:

	1) Design the Program
	2) Write the code
	3) Correct syntax errors
	4) Test the Program
	5) Correct logic errors

syntax vs. logic errors
-syntax = when code has a typo essentially
-logic = when code has a mistake that produces incorrect results

-pseudocode is when programmers design the program in english
and write the code out before actually using the cs language
-flowcharts to map out how the code works
	-ovals for start and end of program
	-parallelograms for input/output steps
	-rectangles for processing/computing steps

print('Hello world')
(calls the print function on the argument 'hello world')
'hello world' in this case is a string literal
-you can use either single or double or triple quotes 

Comments with #
# Either start with a 
or end with a #

variable = name that represents a value stored in the computer memory
"a variable references the value" that it refers to
age = 25

Variable Naming Rules:
	-no key words
	-no spaces
	-first character has to be a letter or _
	-second through last characters must be letter or number or _
	-underscores to represent spaces

garbage collection process when a variable gets reassigned
and the old value no longer has any references to it

nested function calls allow you to do multiple things in one line

escape characters:
	'\n' for new line
	'\t' for new tab
	'\''/'\"' causes a single/double quote to be printed
	'\\' causes a backslash to be printed
